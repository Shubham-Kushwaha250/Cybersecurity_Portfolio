🔐 CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is the foundational model of cybersecurity. It includes three core principles:
1.Confidentiality
Data should only be accessible to authorized users.
Example: Password protection, data encryption.
2.Integrity
Data should remain accurate, consistent, and unaltered. Any unauthorized changes should be detectable.
Example: Hashing, checksums, digital signatures.
3.Availability
Data and systems should always be available to authorized users when needed.
Example: Backups, load balancers, disaster recovery solutions.

🧭 CISSP Domains (8 Domains of Cybersecurity)
CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) defines 8 knowledge areas:
1.Security and Risk Management – Policies, laws, compliance, governance.
2.Asset Security – Data classification, ownership, and handling.
3.Security Architecture and Engineering – Secure system design, cryptography.
4.Communication and Network Security – Firewalls, VPNs, network protocols.
5.Identity and Access Management (IAM) – Authentication and authorization.
6.Security Assessment and Testing – Audits, penetration testing, evaluations.
7.Security Operations – Monitoring, incident response, disaster recovery.
8.Software Development Security – Secure coding, SDLC practices.

⚖️ Security Ethics
1.Security ethics refers to working responsibly and legally in cybersecurity.
2.Respect confidentiality → Do not expose or misuse private data.
3.Adopt a white-hat mindset → Protect systems instead of exploiting them.
4.Follow laws and regulations → Examples: IT Act, GDPR, HIPAA.
5.Be honest in reporting → Report vulnerabilities through proper channels, without hiding them.

🛡️ Common Attacks and Their Effectiveness
Cybersecurity professionals must understand common attack types and why they are effective. Knowing attack methods helps in building better defenses.

📧 Phishing Attacks
Phishing = Trick people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware through fake communication.
   Types of phishing attacks:
     1.Business Email Compromise (BEC): Fake email from trusted source → request for money or data.
     2.Spear Phishing: Targeted attack on a specific person/group. Looks real.
     3.Whaling: Spear phishing aimed at executives (CFO, CEO). High-value target.
     4.Vishing: Voice phishing (phone calls pretending to be bank/authority).
     5.Smishing: SMS/text message phishing.
 
💻 Malware Attacks
Malware = Malicious software designed to harm systems, steal data, or demand money.
  Types of malware:
     1.Viruses: Malicious code that spreads via infected files/attachments. Needs user action.
     2.Worms: Self-replicating malware that spreads automatically across networks.
     3.Ransomware: Encrypts data and demands payment to unlock it.
     4.Spyware: Collects and sends user data secretly (emails, location, voice, keystrokes).

🕵️ Social Engineering Attacks
1.Social engineering = Manipulating human trust to gain access or data.
2.Types of social engineering attacks:
3.Social Media Phishing: Gather info from social media → craft attacks.
4.Watering Hole Attack: Infect websites that a specific group often visits.
5.USB Baiting: Leave an infected USB → victim plugs it in → malware spreads.
6.Physical Social Engineering: Impersonate employee/vendor → gain physical access.

🎭 Why Social Engineering Works (Principles)
1.Authority: Pretend to be a boss, police, or government official.
2.Intimidation: Use fear, bullying, or threats.
3.Consensus / Social Proof: “Others already gave access, so you can too.”
4.Scarcity: “Only limited time to act!”
5.Familiarity: Build emotional connection to exploit later.
6.Trust: Fake friendship or long-term manipulation.
7.Urgency: “Act now or you’ll lose something important!”
