notes upload.

2‚É£ Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks
What You Learn: Threats, risks, frameworks (NIST, OWASP), security controls, SIEM playbooks 
Homework:
Choose an everyday asset (e.g., your mobile phone). Identify threats & vulnerabilities using NIST RMF ‚Üí document as risk_management.md.
Create a simple incident response playbook (in bullet points).
Upload to GitHub.

3‚É£ Connect & Protect: Networks & Network Security
What You Learn: Network architecture, OSI/TCP-IP, firewalls, VPNs, IDS/IPS 
Homework:
Draw/describe OSI vs TCP-IP layers in network_layers.md.
Use Ubuntu/Kali VM: run nmap scan on scanme.nmap.org, save output nmap_scan.txt.
In Wireshark, capture 30 seconds of local HTTP traffic, take a screenshot (wireshark_capture.png) and upload.

4‚É£ Tools of the Trade: Linux & SQL
What You Learn: Linux command-line, SQL basics 
Homework:
Practice Linux commands (ls, chmod, grep etc.), save as linux_commands.md.
Run a sample SQLite database: create table, insert sample log data, run query and save output (sql_queries.txt).
Upload both files.

5‚É£ Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities
What You Learn: Asset classification, threat modeling, MITRE ATT&CK, vulnerability management 
Homework:
On a sample web app (e.g., localhost), list assets, threats, and model them via MITRE ATT&CK techniques into threat_model.md.
Use free tool like [MITRE ATT&CK Navigator Lite] and screenshot into attack_mapping.png.
Upload.

6‚É£ Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response
What You Learn: Incident lifecycle, packet analysis, IDS/SIEM usage, log analysis 
Homework:
Capture network packet (Wireshark) and write a summary of detection method in packet_analysis.md.
Simulate incident: create dummy 'unauthorized login' log and write an incident response steps file (incident_playbook.md).
Upload.

7‚É£ Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python
What You Learn: Python basics, scripting, regex, debugging, file operations
