# Module 1: Introduction to Security Risks  

ðŸ”¹ What are Security Risks?  
Security risks are potential events or conditions that can negatively affect assets (data, systems, people).  
They arise from **threats + vulnerabilities**.  

- Threat = Any potential danger (hackers, malware, insider threats).  
- Vulnerability = Weakness that can be exploited (unpatched software, weak passwords).  
- Risk = Likelihood Ã— Impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.  

---

 ðŸ”¹ Common Types of Security Risks  
1. Operational risks â€“ Poor processes, system failures.  
2. Legal/Compliance risks â€“ Violations of laws/regulations.  
3. Strategic risks â€“ Poor planning or decision-making.  
4. Reputational risks â€“ Negative publicity, customer distrust.

ðŸ”¹ Example  
- Asset: Customer database  
- Threat: Ransomware  
- Vulnerability: Unpatched OS  
- Risk: Data loss, financial damage, legal penalties  


# Module 2: Security Controls  

 ðŸ”¹ What are Security Controls?  
Controls are measures taken to reduce risk by preventing, detecting, or responding to threats.  

---

 ðŸ”¹ Types of Security Controls  
1. Preventive Controls  
   - Stop incidents before they happen.  
   - Example: Firewalls, strong authentication, encryption.  

2. Detective Controls  
   - Identify and alert about ongoing incidents.  
   - Example: IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), SIEM alerts, audit logs.  

3. Corrective Controls  
   - Minimize damage and recover systems.  
   - Example: Backups, patches, incident response plans.  

---

ðŸ”¹ Control Categories  
- Administrative â†’ Policies, training, procedures  
- Technical â†’ Firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus  
- Physical â†’ Locks, CCTV, secure facilities  

---

ðŸ”¹ Example  
- Risk: Unauthorized access to company data  
- Preventive: Multi-factor authentication  
- Detective: Log monitoring with SIEM  
- Corrective: Disable compromised account, restore data from backup
